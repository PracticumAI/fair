## Source data

The data are derived from the [Pulse Rates Before and After Exercise](http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ms212.html) dataset and were intentionally made less usable for the exercise. We do not wish to imply that any of the issues in the sample datasets are part of the source data! The data was supplied by Dr Richard J. Wilson, Department of Mathematics, University of Queensland.
