This series of exercises was developed with funding from NIH.

The markdown pages are formatted to work with links as submodules of the main [practicumai.org](https://practicumai.org) site and may not correctly render links within this repository. Links in the teacher repository are relative to that repository and are not included in the main website.

For access to the teacher version of the repositories, please [fill out the Practicum AI instructor application](https://practicumai.org/instructor_app/)
