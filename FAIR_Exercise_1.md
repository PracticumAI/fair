*Background:* A professor was interested in measuring the effect of exercise on heart pulse rate. He assigned students to record their pulse rate and then either run for one minute or sit for one minute and then record their pulse rate again.

In addition to their pulse, other information about their lifestyle was collected including height, weight, age gender, and smoking and drinking habits.

This experiment was performed over 3-years and the data files for each year are available to you here:
  * [Data/1993_data.xlsx](Data/1993_data.xlsx)
  * [Data/1996 Exercise Data.xlsx](Data/1996 Exercise Data.xlsx)
  * [Data/Run_Sit_data_95.xlsx](Data\Run_Sit_data_95.xlsx)

### Activity

1. (15 minutes) In small groups, open the 3 files and inspect them. What are some problems in the way the data are currently organized?
1. (10 minutes) Suggest a new system for organization. Create a new spreadsheet that can be used as a template for later years of data collection.
